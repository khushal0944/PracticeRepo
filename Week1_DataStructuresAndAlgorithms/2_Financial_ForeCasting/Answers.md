## Exercise 2: Financial Forecasting

### ðŸ”¹ Recursive Algorithms

 - Recursion is a technique where a function solves a scaled-down version of the original problem by calling itself.
 - It facilitates the simplification of repetitive or self-similar problems, like Fibonacci numbers, tree traversals, and compound value calculations.

### ðŸ”¹ Time Complexity:

* **Time Complexity**: O(n), where n = number of years.
* Each recursive call decreases `years` by 1, so the function is called n times.

### ðŸ”¹ Optimization:

* **Tail Recursion or Memoization** could reduce overhead if used with more complex logic.
* **Iterative solution** is better for performance and stack safety.
